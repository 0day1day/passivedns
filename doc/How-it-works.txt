#### PassiveDNS internals

## Packet capture
* Uses libpcap
* Decodes packets as they come in.
* Handles vlan
* Handles IPv4 and IPv6 packets
* We only look at DNS on UDP port 53.

## Connection Tracking
* Same connection tracking as in cxtracker
** When used with a propper BPF (filter),
   it only tracks traffic on port 53 UDP.
* Connection tracking is used to make sure
  that a client asked for a domain, so that
  there will not be any tracking of domains,
  if a client did not request one. A bit spoof
  protection.

## Domain caching
* When a DNS question and answer is recieved, it
  is stored in an internal linked list. If its new,
  we will print the info to the logfile, and we will
  not print it again befor it has gone 24 hours or
  the record has changed. This is to provent flooding
  of data to the log file, and serving you much duplicat
  info.
* If we have not seen any activity agains a domain in 24h,
  it will be deleted from the internal cache.
* If we have not seen any activity of any related entries
  within 24h, it will be deleted...
